Caution Statement

1. For the 2011 NYCHVS, a completely new sample was initially selected from the 2010 decennial census and updated for newly created housing units. For the 2014 and 2017 NYCHVSs, the sample was updated for newly created housing units between the 2011 and 2017 surveys.  The 2002 NYCHVS sample was selected from the 2000 census and updated for the 2005 and 2008 NYCHVSs.

2. The 2017, 2014, and 2011 NYCHVSs were weighted based on the results from the 2010 decennial census, while the 2002, 2005, and 2008 NYCHVSs were all weighted based on results from the 2000 decennial census. Since surveys based on different censuses produce different results (2010 versus 2000), it will be difficult to compare data based on different decennial censuses.

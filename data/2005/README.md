Caution Statement

For the 2005 NYCHVS, the same sample was used as in 2002, drawn from Census 2000 but updated by including newly created housing units, while the 1991 NYCHVS sample was selected from the 1990 census and updated for the 1993, 1996, and 1999 NYCHVSs.
The 2005 and 2002 NYCHVSs were weighted based on the results from Census 2000 , while the 1991, 1993, 1996, and 1999 NYCHVSs were all weighted based on results from the 1990 decennial census. Since surveys based on different censuses produce different results (2000 versus 1990), it may be difficult to compare various data from the 2002 and 2005 NYCHVS to the 1999 NYCHVS and earlier years.

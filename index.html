    <p><em>Summary of user needs and motivating questions.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of the problem, and a reasonable response is proposed.</em></p>
    <p>Housing inequality in urban areas is an issue that impacts millions of people, especially in densely populated areas like NYC. It is essential to analyze and understand the housing disparity patterns of these cities and the factors that affect housing quality. Our project includes housing costs data for NYC from 1991 to 2021. We considered questions like ‘how do housing factors like vacancy rates and rent prices vary in different neighborhoods of NYC?’, ‘do factors like unemployment, rent prices, income, etc affect the housing quality?’, “what roles do transportation access and other things like quality education play in terms of housing inequality. Understanding the historical trends in housing data allows us to identify systemic inequities in housing and pinpoint the areas most in need of intervention. By highlighting the interplay between socioeconomic factors and housing inequality, our project aims to bring attention to communities in New York, specific neighborhoods, that are underserved and our interactive map advocates and shows these neighborhoods with the highest housing inequality rate. Housing inequality in urban areas is an issue that impacts millions of people especially in densely populated areas like NYC. Analyzing and understanding the housing disparities patterns in these cities like our scatterplot, and the factors that affect housing quality is important. By analyzing trends over three decades, we aim to highlight how socioeconomic factors shape housing access and quality. </p>

    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1 class="hd1">Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>
    <p>The dataset we are using explores housing inequality across New York City boroughs by examining key variables such as vacancy rates, elevator availability, income levels, building characteristics, etc. We are looking from the year 1991–2021, and our data is from New York City Housing and Vacancy Surveys. Data preprocessing involved mapping numerical values (e.g., BORO = 1 to Manhattan) to meaningful labels, deriving metrics like average vacancy rates and income by borough, and cleaning invalid or missing data. Additional variables such as population density, rent prices, unemployment rates, and proximity to public transportation could enhance the analysis by providing deeper context. For example, comparing vacancy rates with income and poverty levels highlights economic disparities, while incorporating walkability scores or crime rates can reveal factors affecting housing demand. This dataset also allows us to explore shifts in housing trends over time, such as the impact of gentrification on vacancy rates and affordability in historically low-income neighborhoods. By analyzing patterns of resource allocation, such as access to amenities and public services, we aim to uncover how structural inequality has shaped the housing landscape. Visualizations like heat maps, correlation matrices, and time-series graphs were used to identify clusters of inequality and demonstrate evolving disparities across boroughs. Various visualizations, including scatter plots, bar graphs, and line charts, were used to illustrate trends and correlations, such as higher vacancy rates in lower-income boroughs like the Bronx.

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1 class="hd1">Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>
    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>
    <p>Task 1 which is “How do housing costs differ within New York City?” discovers data on housing costs across the different neighborhoods in New York City. Its goal is to identify patterns and variations in the housing costs. We will then explore trends in the dataset and identify outliers as well, with the goal to provide a spatial understanding of the cost differences between the neighborhoods. Then we will compare contrasting costs and highlight the disparities between the areas.</p>
    <p>Task 2 is “How does housing affordability compare between New York and Boston?”. Although we were able to find a dataset for housing costs and the factors that influence those costs in NYC, we were never able to find a similar dataset for Boston; hence, we cannot really develop on task 2 as we need a similar dataset to draw accurate conclusions from the comparison between the two cities. </p>
    <p>Task 3 is “How have housing costs changed over the past decade in these cities?”. In this task, we will present the housing costs data of NYC from 1991-2021 with the goal to highlight and compare the housing costs and trends in those years. Then we will convert that data into visualizations to facilitate quicker access to the data for browsing it. This will also provide a summary of the housing costs data over the years.</p>
    <p>Task 4 is “What demographic factors influence housing inequality in these cities?”. In this task, we will consider various factors like income, rent prices, unemployment rates, etc to compare the housing disparities within NYC. This uncovers the potential causes of housing inequality. </p>
    

    <h1 class="hd1">Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>
    <p>During our visualization sketches we decided over a variety of sketches we made that we’d represent housing inequality through scatterplots, A detailed map of New York, and line graphs for data over time. These visualizations aim to address our project’s key questions like understanding housing cost disparities or analyzing demographic factors. We also created a scatter plot to address alternate perspectives of housing inequality beyond our main task questions. 
</p>
<p>For the initial process, we created 3 sketches each and finalized the following three for our interactive element:
  <img src="design-sketch.png" alt="Team Final 3 Sketches" style="width:100%;"> 
</p>
<p>We then implemented the visualizations and incorporated interactivity like brushing, linking, and tooltips in our plots and graphs for enhanced user engagement:
  <img src="design1.png" alt="visualizations" style="width:100%;">
  <img src="design2.png" alt="visualizations" style="width:100%;">
</p>
<p>Then we created the final interactive website with interactive plots, and a map to show variable comparisons.</p>


    <h1 class="hd1">Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
    <p>Our project explored the housing inequality in New York City and we analyzed decades worth of data sets from 1991 to 2021 to discover certain patterns and disparities across the city's boroughs. We used important variables such as, vacancy rates, income levels, and building characteristics and we were able to develop our interactive visualizations to illustrate the socioeconomic factors that shape housing access and quality in NYC. During our design process, we created refined sketches and implemented our interactive plots and features using D3.js. Our plots, Heatmaps, and other visualizations showed important trends like dominance of smaller housing units and affordability challenges in low income areas in the boroughs. We also illustrated how housing costs changed over time and how certain demographic factors affect housing costs. Our initial plans included comparing NYC and Boston, but we then decided to focus on NYC due to the lack of comparable housing datasets. So in the future we might incorporate a fitting data set to compare both of the cities. Despite our challenges with standardizing data formats and ensuring interactivity our project successfully gave insights into systemic inequalities in housing. Further improving this project, we could include expanding the analysis to other cities and incorporate more variables like transportation and education access.</p>
